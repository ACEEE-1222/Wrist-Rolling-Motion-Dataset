# Wrist-Rolling-Motion-Dataset
This repository contains the WRM (Wrist-Rolling Motion) dataset, which includes wrist-rolling motion data collected from users attempting to unlock their mobile phones. The dataset captures the dynamics of wrist movements through three types of sensors: the orientation sensor, the linear acceleration sensor, and the gyroscope sensor.
